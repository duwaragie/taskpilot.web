## �️ Project Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd taskpilot.web
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open:** [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

npm run build:local  # Build with type checking for local development

## 📜 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start development server
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm run build:local` — Build with type checking for local development
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build
- `npm run lint` — Lint code


## � Deployment

- **Vercel:** Push to GitHub and import the repo in Vercel. No custom config needed; Vercel auto-detects Vite.
- **Netlify/Firebase:** Build with `npm run build` and deploy the `dist` folder.


## 🔧 API Configuration

- Uses [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for mock REST API:
   - `GET /todos` — Fetch tasks
   - `POST /todos` — Create task
   - `PUT /todos/:id` — Update task
   - `DELETE /todos/:id` — Delete task
- All changes are also saved to localStorage for offline support


## 💡 Assumptions & Design Decisions

- **State Management:** Uses React Context for theme and toast state, main task state is in App.
- **Persistence:** All state is persisted to localStorage for reliability and offline use.
- **Drag & Drop:** Implemented with @dnd-kit for accessibility and smooth UX.
- **UI/UX:** Minimal, modern, and responsive. Dark/light mode with a custom toggle.
- **API:** JSONPlaceholder is used for demonstration; real backend integration is planned.



- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and task statistics
- 🌐 **API Ready**: Prepared for REST API integration

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React useState hooks
- **Icons**: Heroicons (SVG)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Areas for Improvement

- JSONPlaceholder does not persist changes server-side (demo only)
- No authentication or multi-user support
- Limited input validation and error boundaries
- Mobile drag & drop could be improved
- Future: real backend, task categories, PWA, analytics, and more
2. Remove the `englishTaskTitles` mapping if not needed
